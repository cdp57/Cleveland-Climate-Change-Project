This respository contains code for an analysis of historical, emissions-driven changes in temperature and air quality in the Cleveland area. See the "Cleveland Climate Analysis" notebook and supplementary code for data visualization, statistical testing, and regression-based modeling. Data for this project was sources from the [Meteostat API](https://dev.meteostat.net/api/point/monthly.html) (temperature data), [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions) (CO2 emissions data), and the EPA's [Air Quality System API](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html#lists) (PM-2.5 data). This project was created in collaboration with Nathan Chim.
